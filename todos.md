# TODOs

Contact

* [ ] Setup contact-form on Formspree as per instructions in config.toml
* [ ] Test contact-form

Images

* [ ] Fix logo-images - possible remove aliasing, and fix sizes
* [ ] Smaller picture - try making it round

Other 

* [ ] Check that site looks ok in a few reasonable form-factors (seems that my wonderful face-pic is placed a bit weird in some form facts, it seems)
* [ ] Possible increase font a bit.
* [ ] Setup custom 404 page -> /404.html
* [ ] Why the f... does the navbar move slightly from index to subpages?! Seems the navbar gets ~ 17 pixels s,slimmer on the frontpage  (in normal form factor)? Seems to have smth to do with sections on the front page? (If one is removed, the width is the same?!) (Sigh... Why am I a css noob...? )
* [ ] Lesser white margin under red background
* [ ] Remove header "Contact form" 
* [ ] Cookie-policy?
* [ ] Consider the header "Consulting Chief Architect" - does it actually say anything?
* [ ] Rewrite gen_social_mail() to calling gen_mail_to_link()
* [ ] Make a smaller version of logo1 - possibly ask Lena to make it
* [ ] Link to Github for website somewhere?
