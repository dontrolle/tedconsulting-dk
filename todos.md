# TODOs

Contact

* [x] Setup contact-form on Formspree as per instructions in config.toml
* [x] Test contact-form

Images

* [x] Fix logo-images - possible remove aliasing, and fix sizes (_improved a bit_)
* [ ] Improve visuals of logo images
* [ ] Make logo in scalable graphics
* [ ] Consider making a smaller version of logo - possibly ask Lena to make it
* [ ] Get professional me-picture w.o. soft-shell, etc.
* [ ] Possible slight improvement to current picture would be to add a white frame
    - something like:     
        margin: 4px 0 0 4px;
        box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px #fff;
* [x] Slight improvements to face pic

Other 

* [x] Check that site looks ok in a few reasonable form-factors (seems that my wonderful face-pic is placed a bit weird in some form facts, it seems)
* [ ] In broad view, the margins for the text and face picture are off; and the text is to wide
* [x] Possible increase font a bit. (_Not necessary, I think._)
* [x] Setup custom 404 page -> /404.html 
* [ ] Why the f... does the navbar move slightly from index to subpages?! Seems the navbar gets ~ 17 pixels s,slimmer on the frontpage  (in normal form factor)? Seems to have smth to do with sections on the front page? (If one is removed, the width is the same?!) (Sigh... Why am I a css noob...? )
* [x] Lesser white margin under red background
* [ ] Consider removing header "Contact form" 
* [x] Cookie-policy? (_As far as I can read, when I actually use no cookies, this is not necessary._)
* [ ] Consider the header "Consulting Chief Architect" - does it actually say anything?
* [ ] Rewrite gen_social_mail() to calling gen_mail_to_link()
* [ ] Consider dropping lower header and use the colour for about/contact
* [ ] Go to contact-button screams a bit.
* [ ] Consider adding come customers/projects/portfolio/smth
* [ ] From hstuart: "På contact-siden ville jeg sørge for at dit hoved-body laver fill så din footer altid er i bunden af siden og ikke står og flyver mærkeligt længere oppe"

* [X] Top bar on contact page, also
* [X] Mail on contact-page
* [X] Make Contact in footer optional
* [X] Less text in Contact
* [X] Email mailto and not in all-caps
* [X] Basic email-protection
