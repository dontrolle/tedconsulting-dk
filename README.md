# Source code for tedconsulting.dk

This is the source code for the website for my independent consultant website, [TED Consulting](https://tedconsulting.dk).

Made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a slightly modified version of the excellent Hugo template [Hugo-universal-theme](https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme). 

As I am using this site commercially, this site is proprietary software, legally speaking (really it's _nothing_ special). However, feel free to be inspired - but please do not copy the site verbatim. That would just be weird...
